Web Scraping Lab — Coursera
This repository contains the notebook for Lab 4: Collecting Data Using Web Scraping from the Coursera course.

Objectives:
In this lab, I performed the following tasks:
Extracted information from a website using web scraping
Saved the scraped data into a CSV file

Files:
web_scraping_lab.ipynb — Notebook containing the scraping code and results
scraped_data.csv — The extracted data saved as a CSV file (if required/generated)

How to Run:
Open the .ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab / VS Code
Run all cells in order
The CSV file will be generated automatically after running the saving step

This notebook was created as part of a Coursera hands-on lab.
